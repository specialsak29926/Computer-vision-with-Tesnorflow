# Computer-vision-with-Tesnorflow
This repository showcases a computer vision project focused on multi-class image classification using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. The model leverages **ResNet50** through transfer learning, extended with custom dense layers for superior performance. Advanced data augmentation techniques, including rotation, zoom, and shift transformations, were applied to enhance model generalization, with **ImageDataGenerator** streamlining the handling of training and validation datasets. Achieving an impressive **99% classification accuracy**, the project also provides comprehensive performance metrics, such as precision and recall for each class, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the model's effectiveness. This repository serves as a practical guide for building robust and accurate computer vision models.
